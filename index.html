          at the Technical University Munich I created a thermal simulation of
          the transport of lithium-ion battery cells, battery systems and
          electric vehicles. On this webpage I want to share an overview of my
          thesis and some of the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the project was to gain a better understandig of the
          expected temperature during transport of lithium-ion batteries.
          Storing lithium-ion batteries outside of an optimal temperature
          interval can accelerate the ageing process of the cells. Due to ageing
          the cells loose parts of their capacity. <br />
          Lithium-ion batteries are needed for an evergrowing list of different
          products. Focus of the project was the production of battery cells and
          systems for electric vehicles. Because the majority of battery cells
          is currently being produced in Asia, but assembled into battery packs
          and installed in electric vehicles in production plants worldwide,
          long transports are expected. Those transports are typically carried
          out by land and sea. Therefore different types of transport and
          packaging needed to be evaluated.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          To investigate the temperature during transport, a simulation approach
          was chosen. This allowed to quickly analyze a large amount of
          different transports. <br />
          I used the following tools for the project:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python for collecting historical temperature data and controlling
            the simulation
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://www.openfoam.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >OpenFOAM</a
            >
            for thermal CFD simulation running on a Linux machine
          </li>
          <li>Visualization of simulations results with Python and Paraview</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The thermal model was implemented with the CFD software OpenFOAM. To
          generate the input data, control the thermal simulation in OpenFOAM
          and to format and visualize the output data, a Python program was
          implemented. <br />
          As input of the simulation following variables were considerd:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            general data of the transport, i.e., vehicle, start date and time,
            stops
          </li>
          <li>
            thermal properties and geometry of the cargo, packaging and carrier
          </li>
          <li>transport route</li>
          <li>weather data along transport route</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The transport route could either be defined by a set of coordinates or
          via the internal routing service of the institute. The weather data
          was gatherd with a self written tool, that downloads the historical
          temperature data from the closest available weather station. This data
          is available in the integrated-surface-database (<a
            href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database"

            >ISD</a
          >) of NOAA.
        </p>
        <p>The OpenFOAM thermal model considerd following thermal effects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            conduction through the walls of the carrier and inside the batteries
          </li>
          <li>convection on the outside and inside of the carrier</li>
          <li>solar radiation on the outside of the carrier</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It was assumed that the transport carrier is always in full contact
          with the environment, i.e., the carrier is never shaded by other
          objects and always affected by airstream proportional to the traveling
          speed. This was done to reveal the most extreme conditions.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting analysis was a transport from a cell
          manufacturing plant in Poland to a car manufacturing plant in Germany.
          Prior to my work, the institute conducted an experiment, where the
          temperature inside of the truck during this transport was measured. In
          figure 1 you can see the measured and the simulation data. The
          simulation was able to fit the measured data well. The plot also shows
          the ambient temperature that was retrieved from historical weather
          data.
          <br />
          Figure 2 shows a visualization of the transport route and simulation.

          The literature indicated that especially on long transports with
          shipping containers the highest temperatures should be expected.
          Therefore another focus was the investigation of this kind of
          transport.
          <br />
          For the definition of possible routes, sensor data of sea freight
          container transport by
          <a
            href="https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/data-sensordaten-schenker-seefrachtcontainer.html"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >DB Schenker</a
          >
          were used. Figure 3 shows the simulated temperature inside of the
          container aswell as the ambient temperature. Figure 4 shows the route
          of the transport. <br />
          The results show that temperatures up to 55Â°C on an transport of this
          kind can be expected. The figure indicates that the temperature in the
          container mostly follows the ambient temperature but especially in the
          daytime an elevation due to solar radiation exists. Notably the
          highest temperatures are reached when the container is stationary,
          i.e. no forced convection due to an airstream is present.
