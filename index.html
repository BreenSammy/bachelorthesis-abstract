      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        During my bachelor thesis at the
        <a

          >Institute of Automotive Technology</a
        >
        at the Technical University Munich I created a thermal simulation of the
        transport of lithium-ion battery cells, battery systems and electric
        vehicles. On this webpage I want to share an overview of my thesis and
        some of the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the project was to gain a better understandig of the
        expected temperature during transport of lithium-ion batteries. Storing
        lithium-ion batteries outside of an optimal temperature interval can
        accelerate the ageing process of the cells. Due to ageing the cells
        loose parts of their capacity. <br />
        Lithium-ion batteries are needed for an evergrowing list of different
        products. Focus of the project was the production of battery cells and
        systems for electric vehicles. Because the majority of battery cells is
        currently being produced in Asia, but assembled into battery packs and
        installed in electric vehicles in production plants worldwide, long
        transports are expected. Those transports are typically carried out by
        land and sea. Therefore different types of transport and packaging
        needed to be evaluated.
      </p>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To investigate the temperature during transport, a simulation approach
        was chosen. This allowed to quickly analyze a large amount of different
        transports. <br />
        I used the following tools for the project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Python for collecting historical temperature data and controlling the
          simulation
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.openfoam.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >OpenFOAM</a
          >
          for thermal CFD simulation running on a Linux machine
        </li>
        <li>Visualization of simulations results with Python and Paraview</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The thermal model was implemented with the CFD software OpenFOAM. To
        generate the input data, control the thermal simulation in OpenFOAM and
        to format and visualize the output data, a Python program was
        implemented. <br />
        As input of the simulation following variables were considerd:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          general data of the transport, i.e., vehicle, start date and time,
          stops
        </li>
        <li>
          thermal properties and geometry of the cargo, packaging and carrier
        </li>
        <li>transport route</li>
        <li>weather data along transport route</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The transport route could either be defined by a set of coordinates or
        via the internal routing service of the institute. The weather data was
        gatherd with a self written tool, that downloads the historical
        temperature data from the closest available weather station. This data
        is available in the integrated-surface-database (<a
          href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >ISD</a
        >) of NOAA.
      </p>
      <p>The OpenFOAM thermal model considerd following thermal effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          conduction through the walls of the carrier and inside the batteries
        </li>
        <li>convection on the outside and inside of the carrier</li>
        <li>solar radiation on the outside of the carrier</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most interesting analysis was a transport from a cell
        manufacturing plant in Poland to a car manufacturing plant in Germany.
        Prior to my work, the institute conducted an experiment, where the
        temperature inside of the truck during this transport was measured. In
        figure 1 you can see the measured and the simulation data. The
        simulation was able to fit the measured data well. The plot also shows
        the ambient temperature that was retrieved from historical weather data.
        <br />
        Figure 2 shows a visualization of the transport simulation.

        Another focus was the investigation of transports in shipping
        containers. Shipping containers are used for long transports.
